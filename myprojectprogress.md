A possible project idea I have in mind is creating an accounting tracker app that can keep track of how much money is spent and earned/received. 
Not only that, I was also interested in implementing a feature that can keep track of monthly subscription payments as well, and automatically add it to the overall amount spent.
I would be thinking of making it a common or shared repository so that developers would be able to branch off and merge changes when it is time to add their changes.
